# Active Work Ledger

This is the first file every Codex or Claude session must read. It is the live handoff point, not the project history.

## Required Rule

Before answering project-status questions or starting work:

1. Run `git fetch origin --prune`.
2. Check current branch, working tree, latest `origin/main`, open PRs, and remote branches.
3. Read this file first.
4. Read only the extra docs needed for the current task.

If `main`, open PRs, remote branches, and docs disagree, start with:

```text
PROBLEM:
```

Then explain what is inconsistent, why it is risky, and the safe options.

## Current Active Item

### Backlog-driven product work

- Status: no active product branch.
- Last synchronized `main` before this entry: `237e4fc feat: move fleet type settings to fleet`.
- Open PRs when this entry was started: none.
- Purpose:
  - continue backlog-driven work from `docs/backlog.md`;
  - keep the ledger accurate after PR #70.

Older completed work is archived in:

- `docs/archive/progress-log.md`
- `docs/archive/validation-log.md`

## Next Exact Action

1. Sync latest `main`.
2. Continue with the next smallest item from `docs/backlog.md`.
3. Update this ledger in the same PR as the code when the active state changes.

## Last Validation

Latest validation on `main` before this docs cleanup:

- `npm test -- --run`: passed, 8 files / 21 tests.
- `npm run build`: passed.
- Build warning: production bundle is still large because the app is currently a monolith.

Backlog planning verification on branch `codex/create-backlog-plan`:

- Code check: worker activation status, create/reset button, and saved-worker copy-link control are wired in `src/ClaudeMaintenanceApp.jsx`.
- Browser smoke-check: admin login, team screen, department worker list, and worker edit form rendered; worker login state and create-link controls were visible; no console errors were captured.

Topic #14 validation before PR #53:

- `npm test -- --run`: passed, 8 files / 21 tests.
- `npm run build`: passed.
- Browser smoke-check: admin login showed `כלי שינוע`, the old `כלים ותחזוקה` label was not visible, and no console errors were captured.

Current branch validation:

- No active product branch after PR #75 merge.
- PR #64:
  - `npm test -- --run`: passed, 9 files / 25 tests.
  - `npm run build`: passed.
  - Browser smoke-check: admin login, team/users, technician form; individual start/end time fields were visible and the global technician shift selector was not visible.
- PR #61:
  - `npm test -- --run`: passed, 9 files / 25 tests.
  - `npm run build`: passed.
  - Browser smoke-check: not run; no UI behavior changed.

For docs-only changes, test/build may be skipped if the diff is only documentation. For code changes, run:

- `npm test -- --run`
- `npm run build`
- browser smoke-check for UI behavior changes.

## Current Product Direction

- Continue Phase 2 stabilization.
- Current product thread: unified permissions and worker onboarding.
- Do not add new one-off user-card checkboxes.
- Use `perms` and helpers from `src/permissionModel.js`.
- Worker activation/reset remains gated by `workerAccess:manage`.
- Do not start Supabase/Auth/RLS/Railway/database work.
- Do not do a broad modular split.
- Do not replace `src/ClaudeMaintenanceApp.jsx` as a whole file.

## Current Remote Branch Notes

- `origin/claude/clever-ride-z11u7y` is known historical Claude work.
  - Useful docs were already imported separately.
  - Remaining diff was package-lock/platform noise and should not be merged unless explicitly approved.
- Older `origin/codex/*` branches visible during the last sync were already merged into `main`.

## Handoff Back Rule

When handing work back:

- state the branch;
- state the latest commit;
- state whether it is merged into `main`;
- state the next exact action;
- state which checks passed or were not run;
- state blockers using `PROBLEM:`.
- PR #63: technician shifts were documented as individual-only.
  - The backlog now forbids a global technician shift list.
  - Technician `shiftStart`/`shiftEnd` are the intended source of truth.
- PR #64: technician shift editing now uses individual profile times.
  - Technician profile editing shows direct start/end time fields.
  - Saving a technician clears legacy `shiftId`.
  - Technician schedule calculation ignores global `config.shifts`.
