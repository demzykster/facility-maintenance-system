# Active Work Ledger

This is the first file every Codex or Claude session must read. It is the live handoff point, not the project history.

## Required Rule

Before answering project-status questions or starting work:

1. Run `git fetch origin --prune`.
2. Check current branch, working tree, latest `origin/main`, open PRs, and remote branches.
3. Read this file first.
4. Read only the extra docs needed for the current task.

If `main`, open PRs, remote branches, and docs disagree, start with:

```text
PROBLEM:
```

Then explain what is inconsistent, why it is risky, and the safe options.

## Current Active Item

### Asset notification deep-links

- Status: active branch `codex/notification-asset-deeplinks`.
- Last synchronized `main` before this entry: `53d4fd1 fix: deep-link inspection notifications (#107)`.
- Open PRs when this entry was written: none.
- Purpose:
  - make PM notifications open the Fleet periodic-maintenance tab directly;
  - make fleet/document/driver notifications open the Fleet units/drivers tab directly;
  - keep notification generation unchanged.

### Latest Completed Work

- `npm run build`
- browser smoke-check for UI behavior changes.

## Current Product Direction

- Continue Phase 2 stabilization.
- Current product thread: unified permissions and worker onboarding.
- Do not add new one-off user-card checkboxes.
- Use `perms` and helpers from `src/permissionModel.js`.
- Worker activation/reset remains gated by `workerAccess:manage`.
- Do not start Supabase/Auth/RLS/Railway/database work.
- Do not do a broad modular split.
- Do not replace `src/ClaudeMaintenanceApp.jsx` as a whole file.

## Current Remote Branch Notes

- `origin/claude/clever-ride-z11u7y` is known historical Claude work.
  - Useful docs were already imported separately.
  - Remaining diff was package-lock/platform noise and should not be merged unless explicitly approved.
- Older `origin/codex/*` branches visible during the last sync were already merged into `main`.

## Handoff Back Rule

When handing work back:

- state the branch;
- state the latest commit;
- state whether it is merged into `main`;
- state the next exact action;
- state which checks passed or were not run;
- state blockers using `PROBLEM:`.
- PR #63: technician shifts were documented as individual-only.
  - The backlog now forbids a global technician shift list.
  - Technician `shiftStart`/`shiftEnd` are the intended source of truth.
- PR #64: technician shift editing now uses individual profile times.
  - Technician profile editing shows direct start/end time fields.
  - Saving a technician clears legacy `shiftId`.
  - Technician schedule calculation ignores global `config.shifts`.
