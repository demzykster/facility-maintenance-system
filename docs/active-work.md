# Active Work Ledger

This is the first file every Codex session must read. It is the live handoff point, not the project history.

## Required Rule

Before answering project-status questions or starting work:

1. Run `git fetch origin --prune`.
2. Check current branch, working tree, latest `origin/main`, open PRs, and remote branches.
3. Read this file first.
4. Read only the extra docs needed for the current task.

If `main`, open PRs, remote branches, or docs disagree, start with:

```text
PROBLEM:
```

Then explain what is inconsistent, why it is risky, and the safe options.

## Current Active Item

### Active branch: codex/dept-notification-fleet-focus

- Status: ready for PR after local validation.
- Latest synchronized `main`: `cfaafda fix: focus ppe notifications on subtabs (#187)`.
- Open PRs when this entry was written: none.
- Purpose:
  - route manager/user department PM and driver outcome notifications to the exact department fleet card when `fleetId` is available.
  - keep this PR limited to manager/user department notification focus.
- Validation passed before PR:
  - `npm test -- --run`
  - `npm run build`
  - browser smoke-check: current app stayed usable and console had no errors.
  - code-path check: manager/user notifications now carry `fleetId`, `goNotif` passes it into `deptNav`, and `ManagerFleet` opens the matching fleet card when it is in scope.

## Latest Completed Work

- PR #187: PPE notifications now focus relevant sub-tabs.
  - Admin PPE pending/low-stock notifications open the PPE dashboard; open-order notifications open the inventory movement/order tab.
  - Local tests/build/browser smoke-check passed before merge.
- PR #185: Fleet notifications now focus the exact unit card.
  - Admin fleet document and driver request notifications pass `fleetId` into Fleet navigation.
  - Local tests/build/browser smoke-check passed before merge.
- PR #184: Notification matrix ledger was closed.
  - `docs/active-work.md` returned to the current R3 route.
  - Vercel was green before merge.
- PR #183: Department notification route matrix was corrected.
  - The route map now reflects the actual department equipment target.
  - Docs-only validation: `git diff --check`.
- PR #182: Cleaner notifications now route to Cleaning.
  - Cleaning due/overdue and complaint notifications open `בקרת ניקיון`.
  - Local tests/build/browser smoke-check passed before merge.
- PR #181: Team notifications now route to Users.
  - Technician shift notifications open `צוות ומשתמשים`.
  - Local tests/build/browser smoke-check passed before merge.

Older completed work is available in GitHub history and, when needed, in:

- `docs/archive/progress-log.md`
- `docs/archive/validation-log.md`

## Next Exact Action

1. Finish and review `codex/dept-notification-fleet-focus`.
2. If merged, reassess whether R3 can close or whether exact PPE record focus needs a follow-up.
3. Keep each route/focus fix in a separate small PR.

## Documentation Policy

- Keep this file short: current state, last few PRs, next action, blockers.
- Do not use this file as a full PR history. GitHub already does that.
- Update `docs/active-work.md` when:
  - work pauses with an unmerged branch;
  - a product strategy or next action changes;
  - a major block closes;
  - the current contents would mislead the next session.
- Do not update it for every tiny merged PR if `main` is clean and the next step is obvious.
- Update `docs/backlog.md` only when a task is opened, closed, or reprioritized.

## Validation Policy

For code changes:

- `npm test -- --run`
- `npm run build`
- browser smoke-check for UI behavior changes

For docs-only changes:

- `git diff --check` is enough unless package/config/code behavior changes.

## Current Product Direction

- Continue Phase 2 stabilization.
- Current focus: focused UI audit/polish, permissions/onboarding only when explicitly selected, and CMMS workflow correctness.
- Do not add new one-off user-card checkboxes.
- Use `perms` and helpers from `src/permissionModel.js` for access work.
- Worker activation/reset remains gated by `workerAccess:manage`.
- Do not start Supabase/Auth/RLS/Railway/database work.
- Do not do a broad modular split.
- Do not replace `src/ClaudeMaintenanceApp.jsx` as a whole file.

## Handoff Back Rule

When handing work back:

- state the branch;
- state the latest commit;
- state whether it is merged into `main`;
- state the next exact action;
- state which checks passed or were not run;
- state blockers using `PROBLEM:`.
